Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI-powered app that helps parents understand their child’s strengths, challenges, and emotions during the critical ages of 1–4 years. The app provides personalized suggestions for activities, routines, and communication strategies that strengthen the child’s self-esteem, independence, creativity, and emotional development. 


## Background

Many parents want to give their children a strong and secure start in life but often lack clear guidance on how to support their child’s emotional, cognitive, and social development in early childhood. There is a great need for a support tool that is both evidence-based and empathetic.

**Problems addressed:**

* Difficulty for parents to interpret their child’s emotions and behaviors.

* Lack of tailored activities based on the child’s developmental level.

* Insufficient guidance on building routines that support safety and character development.

* Parents feel guilt over frustration or their child's meltdowns – lack strategies to cope.

**My motivation:**
I believe a secure beginning creates secure adults. With the right support for parents during the critical first years, we can build stronger children – and a stronger society.


## How is it used?

The app is used by parents, guardians, and child educators at home or in preschool environments. The user answers questions about the child’s development, daily life, and emotional state. The AI analyzes the answers and provides:

* Suggestions for activities that support the child’s current developmental needs.

* Interpretations of the child’s frustration or behaviors (e.g. tiredness, need for autonomy, overstimulation).

* Tips for how parents can communicate, set boundaries with empathy, and create balance between safety and independence.

* Recommendations for routines (sleep, meals, play, screen time, etc.) based on the child’s age and needs.



This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
**Data sources:**

Open research databases on child developmental psychology.

Interviews with child psychologists and parents.

User-generated data (anonymized feedback from parents).

**Methods:**

NLP (Natural Language Processing) to interpret parents' descriptions of their child’s behavior.

Decision support systems that generate activity recommendations.

Machine learning to improve suggestions over time based on user feedback.


If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

* The app does not replace professional help in cases of developmental disorders.

* Risk of overinterpretation: AI must not "diagnose" but serve as supportive guidance.

* Critical to ensure privacy and secure data storage when handling children’s information.
## What next?

**Future development could include:**

* Additional age groups (5–7 years, 8–12 years)

* Integration with preschool documentation tools

* Sound recognition to analyze tone of voice/crying

* Multilingual and culturally adapted versions

**Needs for further development:**

* Collaboration with child psychologists

* UX designers to ensure a safe and user-friendly experience

* Data engineers to structure developmental data
